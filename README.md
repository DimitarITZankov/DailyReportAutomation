# DailyReportAutomation
In this project I am automating the daily reports for my father's company
Libraries used in the project:
-csv
-pandas
-logging
-datetime
The script works by taking the daily sales, summing all the amount selled of the day and price, then saving them into variable.Next we open the file with the storage left and subtract from it.
This is my first project in GitHub and also first time using it :).
