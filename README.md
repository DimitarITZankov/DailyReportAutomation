# DailyReportAutomation
In this project I am automating the daily reports for my father's company
Libraries used in the project:
-csv
-pandas
-logging
-datetime
The script works by taking the daily sales, suming all the kilograms of the day and price, then saving them into variable.Next we open the file with the storag left and subtract from it.
